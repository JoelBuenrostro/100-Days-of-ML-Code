# 100-Days-of-ML-Code

This is my experience with the challenge 100 days of ML code

## Motivation

In this age of modern technology, there is one resource that we have in abundance: a large amount of structured and unstructured data. In the second half of the 20th century, machine learning evolved as a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) involving self-learning algorithms that derive knowledge from data to make predictions.

100 Days of ML Code is a commitment to better your understanding of this powerful tool by dedicating at least 1 hour of your time every day to studying and/or coding machine learning for 100 days.

See the original repository at [Siraj Raval repository](https://github.com/llSourcell/100_Days_of_ML_Code).

## The 3 Rules

* Make a public pledge to code or study machine learning for minimum 1 hour every day for the next 100 days via your favorite social platform  using the [#100DaysofMLCode](https://twitter.com/sirajraval/status/1014758160572141568) Hashtag.

* Make a public log of your work. Update it daily. Here is a GitHub example template. Another one is here. You can also *make a blog or vlog.

* If you see someone make a post using the #100DaysofMLCode hashtag, encourage them via a 'like', 'share', or comment.

## How I planned my challenge

I schedule my learning based on the structure of some online courses found on the internet and consider to be best evaluated by people.

These courses are extensive enough to accompany me during this challenge and with enough information to not have downtime, in addition to always continuing in the right direction in my learning

## Resources

All resources used (fully or partially) for the challenge:

* [Packtpub Workshops](https://courses.packtpub.com/) - One year of access to any interactive workshop at no charge for registered Packt users.

* [Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/) - This comprehensive course will be your guide to learning how to use the power of Python to analyze data, create beautiful visualizations, and use powerful machine learning algorithms.

* [Python A-Zâ„¢: Python For Data Science With Real Exercises](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-coding/) - Programming In Python For Data Analytics And Data Science. Learn Statistical Analysis, Data Mining And Visualization

* [The Data Science Course 2020: Complete Data Science Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-data-science-course-complete-data-science-bootcamp/) - Complete Data Science Training: Mathematics, Statistics, Python, Advanced Statistics in Python, Machine & Deep Learning.

* [JetBrains Academy](https://hi.hyperskill.org/) - Learn to Program by Creating Working Applications.

* [Understanding Machine Learning with Python](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/python-understanding-machine-learning/table-of-contents) - Use your data to predict future events with the help of machine learning. This course will walk you through creating a machine learning prediction solution and will introduce Python, the scikit-learn library, and the Jupyter Notebook environment.

* [Building Your First Machine Learning Solution](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/building-machine-learning-solution/table-of-contents) - Machine learning is exciting, yet, it may sound more complicated than it is actually is. This course empowers you with the necessary theory and practice to become confident about how machine learning works by building a hands-on solution.

* [The Supervised Learning Workshop](https://courses.packtpub.com/courses/supervised-learning) - The Supervised Learning Workshop focuses on building up your practical skills so that you can deploy and build solutions that leverage key supervised learning
algorithms.

* [Using Python for Research](https://www.edx.org/course/using-python-for-research) - This course bridges the gap between introductory and advanced courses in Python. While there are many excellent introductory Python courses available, most typically do not go deep enough for you to apply your Python skills to research projects. In this course, after first reviewing the basics of Python 3, we learn about tools commonly used in research settings. This version of the course includes a new module on statistical learning.

* [Building Regression Models with scikit-learn](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/building-regression-models-scikit-learn/table-of-contents) - This course covers important techniques such as ordinary least squares regression, moving on to lasso, ridge, and Elastic Net, and advanced techniques such as Support Vector Regression and Stochastic Gradient Descent Regression.

* [r/datascience](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/) - A place for data science practitioners and professionals to discuss and debate data science career questions.

* [r/MachineLearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/) - Welcome to MachineLearning

* [r/learnmachinelearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/) - A subreddit dedicated to learning machine learning.

* [Machine learning matery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/) - Excelent site with good content about machine learning for developers

## Datasets
