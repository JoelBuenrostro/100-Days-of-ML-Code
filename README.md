# 100-Days-of-ML-Code

This is my log from the challenge 100 days of ML code

## The 3 Rules

*Make a public pledge to code or study machine learning for minimum 1 hour every day for the next 100 days via your favorite social platform  using the #100DaysofMLCode Hashtag.

*Make a public log of your work. Update it daily. Here is a GitHub example template. Another one is here. You can also *make a blog or vlog.

*If you see someone make a post using the #100DaysofMLCode hashtag, encourage them via a 'like', 'share', or comment!
