# 100-Days-of-ML-Code

This is my experience with the challenge 100 days of ML code

## Motivation

In this age of modern technology, there is one resource that we have in abundance: a large amount of structured and unstructured data. In the second half of the 20th century, machine learning evolved as a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) involving self-learning algorithms that derive knowledge from data to make predictions.

100 Days of ML Code is a commitment to better your understanding of this powerful tool by dedicating at least 1 hour of your time every day to studying and/or coding machine learning for 100 days.

See the original repository at [Siraj Raval repository](https://github.com/llSourcell/100_Days_of_ML_Code).

## The 3 Rules

* Make a public pledge to code or study machine learning for minimum 1 hour every day for the next 100 days via your favorite social platform  using the [#100DaysofMLCode](https://twitter.com/sirajraval/status/1014758160572141568) Hashtag.

* Make a public log of your work. Update it daily. Here is a GitHub example template. Another one is here. You can also *make a blog or vlog.

* If you see someone make a post using the #100DaysofMLCode hashtag, encourage them via a 'like', 'share', or comment.

## How I planned my challenge

I schedule my learning based on the structure of some online courses found on the internet and consider to be best evaluated by people.

These courses are extensive enough to accompany me during this challenge and with enough information to not have downtime, in addition to always continuing in the right direction in my learning

## Resources

All resources used (fully or partially) for the challenge:

* [Packtpub Workshops](https://courses.packtpub.com/) - One year of access to any interactive workshop at no charge for registered Packt users.

* [Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/) - This comprehensive course will be your guide to learning how to use the power of Python to analyze data, create beautiful visualizations, and use powerful machine learning algorithms.
