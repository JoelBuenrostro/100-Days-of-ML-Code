# 100-Days-of-ML-Code

This is my experience with the challenge 100 days of ML code

## Motivation

100 Days of ML Code is a committment to better your understanding of this powerful tool by dedicating at least 1 hour of your time everyday to studying and/or coding machine learning for 100 days.

See the original repository at [Siraj Raval repository](https://github.com/llSourcell/100_Days_of_ML_Code).

## The 3 Rules

* Make a public pledge to code or study machine learning for minimum 1 hour every day for the next 100 days via your favorite social platform  using the [#100DaysofMLCode](https://twitter.com/sirajraval/status/1014758160572141568) Hashtag.

* Make a public log of your work. Update it daily. Here is a GitHub example template. Another one is here. You can also *make a blog or vlog.

* If you see someone make a post using the #100DaysofMLCode hashtag, encourage them via a 'like', 'share', or comment!

## How i plan the challenge

Plan my learning based on the structure of the two online courses that I consider to be best evaluated by people who already work in the field of data science

[Machine Learningby Stanford University taught by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/info)

[Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp taught by Jose Portilla](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/)

These courses are extensive enough to accompany me during this challenge and with enough information to not have downtime, in addition to always continuing in the right direction in my learning
